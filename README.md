&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This software is a TFTP client in Python developed as a student project to
UFCD 5119 of Professor Jo√£o Galamba from IEFP for the Specialist Technical
course CET-TEGRSI 012.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended as a simple client for TFTP to be run by calling python
directly or by the use of the shebang infra-structure, coded in a main file
client.py and using a module tftp.py for main TFTP functionality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended to be used as is and it is not planned to be further
developed.
